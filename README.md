# Project Title - 
  One Place to Find Your Trainer

# Problem Statement:-

In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to find reliable sources for sports-related information and access to quality trainers. Despite the presence of experienced staff and trainers, there remains a gap in connecting them with potential athletes of different age groups. Additionally, there's a need for a centralized platform that caters to diverse sports communities, organized by age groups, facilitating seamless communication and interaction.
This web-based application has been developed for the accomplishment of Future Ready Talent Internship program launched by Microsoft, Future Skills Prime and Github.

# Project Description:-

To address these challenges, we aim to develop a comprehensive sports community platform with integrated chatbot functionality. The platform will serve as a one-stop solution, providing access to trained professionals, fostering community engagement among different age groups, and offering instant access to sports-related information through a user-friendly chatbot interface.
We have developed a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bootstrap and Azure Portal that serves as an online platform for sports enthusiasts.
